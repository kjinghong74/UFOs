# UFO Sightings Exploration

## **Overview of Project**
  The goal of this project is to design a functional and dynamic webpage that provide the articles and UFO sighting information for the users. A page hearder is placed on the top of the webpage. An article about UFO sightings including the title and the article paragraph was placed underneath the header. A filterable table to display the data on UFO sightings was generated with five table filters (Date, City, State, Country, and Shape) on the side of the table.
  
  
## **Results**
- The users can filter the table according to Date, City, State, Country, and Shape of the UFO sightings. A complete data table is displaced on the webpage after initial loading, if user want to filter the UFO sightings identified in certain state, such as in ak, the the user need enter "ak" in the table filter of "Enter State". Then the table will only show UFO sightings in ak (Fig 1). If user is further interested in "sphere" shape of the UFOs in ak, they can then enter "sphere" in the table filter of "Enter Shape". This will only bring the data showing the UFO in sphere shape in ak (Fig 2).

## **Summary**
  The temperature in Dec in Oahu is only a few degree lower compared to the temperature in Jun. Therefore, there is not too much temperature difference in Oahu even between summer season and winter season. So, the temperature is quite sustainable year-round. That is good for opening surf and ice cream shop. But there are other parameters heavely affect the cosumers' habit for surfing and ice cream too, such as the precipitation level and geography location. We should also include two other queries for data analysis. (1) the precipitation level in Jun and Dec; (2) whether temperature and precipitaition level differ at locations, which can be analyzed bases on the parameters for latitude, longitude and elevation.
