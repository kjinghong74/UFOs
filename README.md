# UFO Sightings Exploration

## **Overview of Project**
  The goal of this project is to design a functional and dynamic webpage that provide the articles and UFO sighting information for the users. A page hearder is placed on the top of the webpage. An article about UFO sightings including the title and the article paragraph was placed underneath the header. A filterable table to display the data on UFO sightings was generated with five table filters (Date, City, State, Country, and Shape) on the side of the table.
  
  
## **Results**
- The users can filter the table according to Date, City, State, Country, and Shape of the UFO sightings. A complete data table is displaced on the webpage after initial loading, if user want to filter the UFO sightings identified in certain state, such as in ak, user need enter "ak" in the table filter of "Enter State". Then the table will only show UFO sightings in ak (Fig 1). If user is further interested in "sphere" shape of the UFOs in ak, they can then enter "sphere" in the table filter of "Enter Shape". This will only bring the data showing the UFO in sphere shape in ak (Fig 2).

## **Summary**
- One drawback of this webpage is the article and the table has fixed data, which can't not be updated with the newest findings
- Two recommendations for further develpment. (1) The script can be designed to scrape the most recent news or article about UFO so that user can see the update of new articles when they visit the webpage next time. (2) UFO data can be imported using API call, so that new data can be added into the datatable. These changes will make this webpage updatable.
